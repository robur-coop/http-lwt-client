## v0.2.0 (2022-11-03)

* API: In the body function passed to request, the response is the first

## v0.1.0 (2022-10-25)

## v0.0.8 (2022-09-17)

  #12 by @kit-ty-kate, fixed in #13 by @dinosaure)

  state across requests
* Initialize Ca_certs.authenticator only once (lazily) to avoid decoding
  trust anchors multiple times
* Fix Http_lwt_unix.Buffer for resizing on put (to avoid errors with H2)
* Avoid exceptions from Lwt.wakeup_later by calling it at most once

## v0.0.3 (2021-09-07)
